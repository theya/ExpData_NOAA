### Synopsis

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.  
  
The basic goal is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer the following questions about severe weather events:  
1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?  
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
  
More information about the variables in the dataset are given by the:  
1. National Weather Service [Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)  
2. And National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)
